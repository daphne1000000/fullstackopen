This document is all of my notes for Unit 2 of Fullstack Open. There are lots of links to various materials, so I want to make sure that I am up to speed
on as much of this stuff as possible :). 

_JAVASCRIPT ARRAYS_
	* General Overview
		* The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable
		  name, and has members for performing common array operations
		* 
	* Higher-order functions video
		* Why learn functional programming?
			* It will make you a better programmer :)
			* Your code will have less bug (because it's easier to reason about) and take less time to write (because it's easier to reuse
		* Functions are values
		* Composition of functions (i.e. taking smaller functions and putting them into a bigger function)
		* For example, instead of filtering out via a loop, we can just use the filter function.
	* Map video
		* Just like filter, map is another higher-order function.
		* Unlike filter, it returns back an object that has been transformed from the original object.
		* This provides an easy way to make a new array that is different from the original
	* Reduce basics
		* Yet another higher order function :)
		* Also allows us to transform an array
_EVENT HANDLING_
	* Event handling has proven to be a difficult topic for students
	* When making a button, in order to make the button react to a click event, we have to add an event handler to it
	* This event handler must be a function with a return value
	* You will often see event handlers defined in a separate place than the button, such as a function called handleClick
	* You can also make the event handler a function that returns a function in case you want to attach extra values to be transformed
_RENDERING THE ELEMENTS OF AN ARRAY_
	* Each item rendered dynamically must have a key-value associated with it. 
	* To render a list, we can create a map with each key value pair mapped onto an <li>
	* It is an anti-pattern to use the array indexes as the key
